This project uses C# and dotnet to get data from a users Google Calendars.
It uses Googles libs as described in https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/dotnet 
and shows the data as Json with an api. 

Test run: Press F5 in VS Code.

Open https://localhost:5001/api/GcalItems/getevents in browser.

Publish for Raspberry Pi 2:
dotnet publish -r linux-arm
Then copy the publish folder to the server/Pi. (/home/patrik/Programmering/csharp/gcalApi/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/linux-arm/publish/).
In the systemd folder there is a service scirpt that can be used to start/stop the service automatically. Adjust the folders in the script if needed. 

When the service is started, try to connect to http://<PI IP>:8080/api/GcalItems/getevents. The first time the code is run it needs to authenticate with Google, 
a process that needs a web browser.
